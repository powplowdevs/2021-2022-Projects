    Create a variable, question, to capture and hold the question the user asked from the browser.
    Create a variable, length, for the length of the question the user asked.
    Create a variable, random, to hold a random number that is generated using the length of the question.  
    Create a variable, numberOfFortunes, to hold the number of fortune response that you have prepared
    Use modulus and numberOfFortunes to keep random within the range of fortunes that you created. Reassign the new value to random.
    Create a control structure that picks between 5 or more prepared responses to send back to the user on the browser.
